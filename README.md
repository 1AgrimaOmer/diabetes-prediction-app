Diabetes Prediction App (Machine Learning Project)

This project is a Machine Learning based application that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical input parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, etc.

It is built using Python and a trained ML model and presented through a simple Streamlit web interface.
